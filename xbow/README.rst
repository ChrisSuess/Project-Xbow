Project-Xbow
============

**Xbow** allows you to create your own custom compute cluster in the cloud. The cluster has a "head' node that you communicate with and can log in to, a number of 'worker' nodes to run your jobs, and a shared file system that links them all together.

Currently **Xbow** runs only on Amazon Web Services (AWS), and you must have an AWS account set up before you can use **Xbow**.


Getting and Installing **Xbow**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The recommended method to install **Xbow** is using pip::

    pip install xbow


Configuring **Xbow**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before configuring **Xbow**, you must configure your AWS environment. Follow the instructions `here <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html>`_ to do that.

Once you have raeched the point where you have a ``$HOME/.aws`` folder containing a ``config`` and ``credentials`` file you are ready to use **Xbow**!

First configure **Xbow** itself, by running the command::

    xbow-configure

This command creates a directory ``$HOME/.xbow`` containing a number of files, including ``settings.yml`` which you can edit at any time in the future to adjust the make-up of your **Xbow** cluster.

The default values in ``settings.yml`` will launch a **Xbow** cliuster consisting of a head node and two worker nodes. The
head node will be a ``t2.small`` instance and each worker will be a ``g2.2xlarge`` instance. The head node is a conventional
instance but the workers are "spot" instances - see the AWS documentation _`here<https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/>`_. All
instances use the same image; the default provides pre-installed versions of Gromacs2018 and AmberTools16 (i.e.,
the MD engines ``gmx mdrun``, ``sander`` and ``sander.MPI``, but not ``pmemd`` as an Amber license is required to use this and 
we can't assume you have one).


Creating an Xbow Filesystem
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If this is the first time you have used **Xbow** you will need to create a shared filesystem for use with **Xbow**. This is done by running the command::

    xbow-create_filesystem

This only needs to be performed once and **Xbow** handles all the configuration settings.

Creating an **Xbow** Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a new **Xbow** cluster, run the command::

    xbow-create_cluster

This command will create the head node, worker nodes, and shared file system according to the specification in your ``settings.yml`` file.

Using Your **Xbow** Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Log in to the head node using the command::

    xbow-login_instance

The simplest way to run jobs on your **Xbow** cluster is to use the **Xflow** tool. See `here <https://github.com/ChrisSuess/Project-Xbow/wiki/An-Introduction-to-Xbowflow-Workflows>`_ for details.

Transferring Data to your **Xbow** Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To use **Xbow** you first create a folder on your local workstation in which you place all required input files
for your simulation. You then copy the whole folder to the shared filesystem on the **Xbow** cluster, log in to the cluster
and run the job, and when it has finished copy all the results files back to your local machine.

To **Sync** data between your machine and your **Xbow** cluster use the command::

    xbow-sync

Deleting Your **Xbow** Cluster
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Remember that, as a cloud resource, you are paying for your **Xbow** cluster whether you are using it or not, so once your jobs are finished, you should delete it. Deleting the cluster does NOT delete the shared file system though, so at any time you can create a new **Xbow** cluster and your data will still be there. 

To delete the entire cluster::

    xbow-delete_cluster

To delete the workers and keep the head node alive use the command::

    xbow-delete_workers

Running an Example **Xbow** Job
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Obtain the example files
---------------------------
Download the examples tarball::

    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChrisSuess/Project-Xbow/devel/xbowflow/examples.tgz -o examples.tgz

Then uncompress this::

    tar -zxvf examples.tgz

This should create a new folder called *examples*. For this example we are going to use the files in the folder
*SimpleJobs/Gromacs* which will run a short MD simulation of BPTI::

    cd examples/SimpleJobs/Gromacs
    
2. Launch your **Xbow** cluster
-------------------------------

If you have not already done so, create your **Xbow** environment: run ``xbow-configure`` and ``xbow-create_filesystem`` 
(see above).

Next launch your **Xbow** cluster.::

    xbow-create_cluster

(Note this step may take five minutes or so to complete.)

3. Transfer the input data to your **Xbow** cluster
----------------------------------------------------

Making sure you are in the examples/SimpleJobs/Gromacs folder, sync the data with your **Xbow** cluster::

    xbow-sync

This will transfer your files to the folder ~/shared/Gromacs on your **Xbow** cluster.

4. Login to your cluster and run the job
----------------------------------------
Login to your **Xbow** cluster::

    xbow-login

Navigate to the directory containing the example files::

    cd shared/SimpleJobs/Gromacs

Using **Xflow** run the example::

    xflow-exec ./run.sh

5. Copy the results back to your local machine and delete the cluster
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Log off your **Xbow** cluster::

    ctrl + d

Now you should be back in the Gromacs folder on your local workstation. Sync the data back from the **Xbow** cluster::

    xbow-sync

This brings back all the your data from the cloud.

Unless you want to try one of the other examples, delete the cluster::

    xbow-delete_cluster
