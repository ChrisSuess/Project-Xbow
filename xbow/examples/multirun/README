Skeleton for a simple multi-replicate MD workflow.
Individual MD jobs share the same input files but write their outputs
to unique subdirectories.

The file multirun.xcf defines the workflow, while system.yaml provides the
input parameters for this instance

to run:

xflow-run multirun.xcf system.yaml
