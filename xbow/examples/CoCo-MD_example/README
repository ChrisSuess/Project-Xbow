The files in this folder show how to run a CoCo_MD enhanced sampling simulation
for cyclosporine A, using AMBER as the MD code.

To test the workflow type:
% xflow-run cocomd.xcf csaw.yaml

This will print out all the commands that would be run.

The file cocomd.xcf contains the workflow definition.
The file csaw.yaml contains the inputs for this instance of the workflow.

The other files are the various Amber and pyCoCo input files.

The workflow goes someting like this:

1. From an ensemble of structures, use pyCoCo to identify unsampled regions
   and generate possible new structures that correspond to them.
2. Using a series of targeted MD simulations, move a well-equilibrated
   structure of the molecule towards each of the CoCo generated structures (as
   these themselves can be too 'rough' for use directly).
3. Run production MD from each of the optimised structures, and add the new
   trajectory data to the ensemble.
4. Go back to step 1, until you have enough data.

Once you think the workflow looks OK, open cocomd.xcf in a text editor and 
change the line 'dryrun: True' to 'dryrun: False'

Then assuming you are on a well-configured xbow cluster, you can run the
workflow interactively by issuing the same command:

% xflow-run cocomd.xcf csaw.yaml

Or you can submit it as a background job using xflow-submit:

% xflow-submit 'xflow-run cocomd.xcf csaw.yaml'
