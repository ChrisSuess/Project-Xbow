The files in this folder show how to run a CoCo_MD enhanced sampling simulation
for cyclosporine A, using AMBER as the MD code.

The Python script runs the workflow, and contains most of the documentation.

The workflow goes someting like this:

1. From an ensemble of structures, use pyCoCo to identify unsampled regions
   and generate possible new structures that correspond to them.
2. Using a set of targeted MD simulations, move a well-equilibrated structure 
   of the molecule towards each of the CoCo generated structures (as these 
   themselves can be too 'rough' for use directly).
3. Run production MD from each of the optimised structures, and add the new
   trajectory data to the ensemble.
4. Go back to step 1, until you have enough data.
