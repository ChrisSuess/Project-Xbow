**Crossbow** is an EPSRC-funded project to develop software that makes it easier for Biomolecular Simulation scientists to use
Cloud computing resources.

This repository contains two linked packages: [xbow](https://github.com/ChrisSuess/Project-Xbow/tree/devel/xbow) and [xbowflow](https://github.com/ChrisSuess/Project-Xbow/tree/devel/xbowflow).

**Xbow** provides tools that enable a computational scientist with little experience of cloud computing to launch a personal, 
tailored, compute cluster in the cloud, and to run simple jobs on it (e.g. molecular dynamics simulations) directly from their
local workstation/laptop.

**Xbowflow** provides tools that allows more experienced biomolecular simulation scientists to create custom workflows that
run complex large-scale calculations across an **xbow** cluster.
