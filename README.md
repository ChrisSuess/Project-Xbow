Crossbow
============

**Crossbow** is an EPSRC-funded project to develop software that makes it easier for Biomolecular Simulation scientists to use
Cloud computing resources.

This repository contains two linked packages: [xbow](https://github.com/ChrisSuess/Project-Xbow/tree/master/xbow) and [xbowflow](https://github.com/ChrisSuess/Project-Xbow/tree/master/xbowflow).

[**Xbow**](https://github.com/ChrisSuess/Project-Xbow/tree/master/xbow) provides tools that enable a computational scientist with little experience of cloud computing to launch a personal, 
tailored, compute cluster in the cloud, and to run simple jobs on it (e.g. molecular dynamics simulations) directly from their
local workstation/laptop.

[**Xbowflow**](https://github.com/ChrisSuess/Project-Xbow/tree/master/xbowflow) provides tools that allows more experienced biomolecular simulation scientists to create custom workflows that
run complex large-scale calculations across an **xbow** cluster.
