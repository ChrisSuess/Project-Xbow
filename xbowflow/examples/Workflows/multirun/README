Skeleton for a simple multi-replicate MD workflow.
Individual MD jobs share the same simulation protocol but write their outputs
to unique subdirectories.

The file multirun.xcf defines the workflow, while systems.yaml provides the
input parameters for this instance

to run:

xflow-run multirun.xcf systems.yaml

Note this a skeleton only and cannot be run for real.
