Four Gromacs MD jobs run in parallel.

Each job starts from the same tpr file, but writes output data to a separate
subdirectory.

The file multirun.xcf defines the workflow, while bpti.yaml provides the
input parameters for this instance

before running:

0. Make sure your verion of xbowflow >= 0.0.26

1. Edit bpti.yaml to set the correct path to the shared directory (the ones 
   these files are in)
2. (Optional) If you want to change the length of the MD job, edit mdrun.mdp 
   and re-run grompp to generate a new bpti.tpr file (see compile.sh).

to run interactively:

  xflow-run multirun.xcf bpti.yaml

or as a batch job:

  xflow-submit ./run.sh
