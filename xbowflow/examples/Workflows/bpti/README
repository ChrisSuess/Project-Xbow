Four Gromacs MD jobs run in parallel.

Each job starts from a separate tpr file, and writes output data to a separate
subdirectory. The examople actually uses the same system each time, but the
runs start with different velocity distributions.

The file multirun.py defines the workflow, while bpti.yaml provides the
input parameters for this instance

before running:

1. (Optional) If you want to change the length of the MD job, edit mdrun.mdp 
   and re-run grompp to generate new bpti.tpr files (see compile.sh).

to run:

  python multirun.py bpti.yaml
