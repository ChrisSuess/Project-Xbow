**Make Peptides**::
    This workflow creates Amber format coordinate and topology files for
    a series of tripeptides. Each tripeptide is built in an extended
    conformation, solvated in an octahedral box of TIP3P water, neutralised
    by the addition of sufficient Na+ or Cl- counterions, and subjected to
    a three-stage equilibration procedure. Files for each system are then
    written out to separate subdirectories.
