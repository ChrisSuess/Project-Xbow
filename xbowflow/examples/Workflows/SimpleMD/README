This folder illustrates a very basic workflow that runs a single MD
simulation using AMBER pmemd (which you need to have installed).

The workflow is defined in the file simplemd.xcf
The input data for this run (on cyclosporine A) are defined in csa.yaml
The other files are input files required to run the simulation

To run the job interactively, type:

xflow-run simplemd.xcf csa.yaml
